                     Delphes Macro Files Generator
                            ~one python file~
________________________________________________________________

  *** This python script stands as the base code for generating 
      the required files to run Delphes with Pythia8 together,
      using the "./DelphesPythia8" optional executable shipped
      with Delphes.
      
  *** The first part of "generate_delphes_macros.py" contains 
      the options section in which you enter the <name> of the 
      folder in which the following files will be created:
	  
      -> The input "<name>.cmnd" file is generated by writting 
         strings in Pythia8 format. Options are availabe for this 
         part.

      -> The analysis "get_variables.C" ROOT file is created
         automatically the same. It extracts information from 
         the output <name>.root and writes "variables.root"
         in which the following trees will be created:
         -> Electrons
         -> Positrons
         -> Dielectrons
         -> Jets
         This file is used for analyzing the dielectrons final
         state.
         No actual options included in the python script, change
         manually if you want.
________________________________________________________________
  *** Let's run the default example step by step:
  	  
      -> python3 generate_delphes_macros.py (ff_Z_ee folder
         should be created.)
  	 
      -> cd ff_Z_ee
  	  
      -> Open the ff_Z_ee.cmnd file and copy the run command,
         then paste it to a terminal in the Delphes installation
         directory. Delphes should start running, creating two
         files: 
         -> "ff_Z_ee.log" (Pythia8 log) 
         -> "ff_Z_ee.root" (Delphes output in root format)
  	  
      -> Open the "get_variables.C" file and copy the run command
         then paste it to a terminal in the current directory. 
         -> "variables.root" should appear, check it out with the
            ROOT TBrowser.
  
  *** Please ensure that "libDelphes.so" is exported to path, for
      the "get_variables.C" to work.
	  
  *** The default example is f f~ -> Z (s-channel) -> e- e+ as 
      the hard process with 5k events and a center of mass energy
      of 13.6 TeV. Things were kept simple, no MPI, ISR, FSR.
      Hadronization is on for consistency. Default card is:
      -> delphes_card_ATLAS.tcl
        (located in <delphes install dir>/cards/)
________________________________________________________________
  *** Customize the script for any process:
  
      -> Open the "generate_delphes_macros.py". You may generate 
         whatever .cmnd file you desire.

     *** Change main options:
         -> name (name of the directory to be generated)
	 -> card (choose one from <delphes_install_folder>/cards)
         -> hard_process (matters only for printing)
         -> Nevents (number of events)
         -> Beam settings (idA, idB, eCM)

     *** Append the options you would like in Pythia8 string 
         format:
         -> Hard process (necessary)
         -> Optional settings (desired Pythia8 input strings)

     *** After generating the folder "<name>" look inside it,
         open the "<name>.cmnd" file and copy-paste the command
         in a terminal in the Delphes installation directory.

     *** NOTE: ./DelphesPythia8 will work with any input .cmnd
         file you will use. However, the included ROOT script 
         "get_variables.C" mainly searches for dielectron final 
         states, so use it for Delphes .root outputs in which 
         at least an e-e+ pair is produced in an event.
